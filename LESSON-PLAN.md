# Lesson Plan

## Some of the main topics
1. CSS Design System
  - Utility classes and custom properties
2. Flexbox and Grid
3. Accessibility

## Approach
1. Custom properties - Great
2. Utility classes - Take time to set up but Save time in the long run
3. Don't stress to much on layout
4. When finished won't have all the layout parts we need but we'll be off to a running start
